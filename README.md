# The Devil's Gambit

The Devil's Gambit is a bingo style math game for Wanna x Yam Game Jam 2022.

How to Play: Drag and Drop numbers (from the right grid) and operators (top left grid) in the equation slots at the bottom of the screen to combine numbers and create an answer. If any of your answers matches one of the numbers in the middle grid, your score will increase. But beware, because time is not on your side. And the devil is literally evil, so he'll try to make this harder after you reach a certain score.

Story:  A gamer dies suddenly and is meant to go to hell. But since the devil is bored, he gives the man an option to play a game of numbers and win his ticket out of hell. The gamer chooses the game without any hesitation. But little does he know, the devil never planned to give him a way out. The devil slowly makes the game harder, making it almost impossible to win. So now he is stuck in an endless loop of  playing the same game again and again while giving the devil some entertainment. Are you smart enough to outwit the devil?
